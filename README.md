## Details
Created as challenge five of FreeCodeCamp's Dynamic Web Design Course

Tasked with creating a personal portfolio on CodePen.
Words dynamically on mobile but best viewed via laptop. Was not completely finalised by the time of upload for the certificiation.
I am likely to take elements of this project and adapt my already exsisiting website to demonstrate some of these new skills I have learnt.
